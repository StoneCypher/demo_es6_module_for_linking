# demo_es6_module_for_linking
a trivial es6 module to show that any downstream linker consumes and exposes es6 from npm correctly

just `npm install --save-dev demo_es6_module_for_linking`



## ... why?

So maybe you just set up `rollup`, `webpack`, `browserify`, `closure compiler`, `requirify`, `jspm`, 
`traceur`, `rx`, `broccoli`, `brunch`, `meteor`, `yeoman`, `rails pipeline`, `elixir`, `typescript reduce`, 
`bower`, or what have you.

So maybe you just want to see something trivial, in `ES6`, from `NPM`, go through your system.

This is for you.
